Our first GreenProjects meeting will host two awesome projects “Cosmos” and “Sustain.ALL”. These projects have set their missions to tackle specific problems to fight global warming and climate change. They will present their approach and mission to heal the world.

Both startups/projects will have 15 minutes for their pitch to answere following questions:
- Which problem did they identify?
- How big is the impact on the environment of the identified problem?
- What is the project's answer / solution to the problem?
- Which stage of the product/services development process have they reached?
- Who is in their team?
- Which help does they need from the GreenCoding Community?

Afterwards we will have time to discuss the problem further and to brainstorm solutions.
