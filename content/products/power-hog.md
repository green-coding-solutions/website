The Power Hog offers a suite of tools designed to track your computer's energy consumption.
Currently the three primary objectives are:

1) Allow the user to analyze which processes uses how much energy and carbon and how this relates to the system.
2) Collect power usage data centrally to identify apps/ processes that could be optimized to save energy on a wider scale.
3) Enable the user to submit the data to a carbon database so that energy usage can be accounted to a project (See [CarbonDB](/products/carbondb))

Currently we only support *macOS* through the *powermetrics* [[1]]({{< relref path="blog/power-measurement-on-macos" >}}) tool! 

A full readme and documentation can be found in the GitHub repo.

- **We are actively looking for beta testers for our Windows and Linux clients - Please reach out!**
