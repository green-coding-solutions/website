In today’s environmentally-conscious world, businesses are increasingly held accountable for their carbon footprints. The new European reporting guidelines underscore this shift, demanding precise and comprehensive carbon usage data from companies. This is what CarbonDB tries to solve. Designed to centralize and streamline the management of energy data and carbon emissions for businesses of all sizes. Of course it can also be used for personal use.

### The Problem

As companies expand and diversify, managing energy consumption data from various sources becomes a daunting task. This complexity is compounded by the need to convert energy usage into carbon emissions data, considering the varying grid intensities at different times. Accurate reporting on carbon usage, essential for compliance with European guidelines and for fostering sustainable practices, remains out of reach for many.
