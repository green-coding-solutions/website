## Community Version / Enterprise Version

We believe in open source and that for advancing sustainable software the measurement tools must be freely accessible
and falsifyable.

The **community version** gives you all the functionality for measurement and benchmarking with an <u>free open source AGPL-v3 license.</u>

However we also offer a **hosted version** as **SaaS** which includes some premium features and a support plan.
