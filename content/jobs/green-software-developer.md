description: "Open role for Green Software Developer with 5+ years experience at Green Coding Solutions GmbH to work on sustainable software."
---

At Green Coding Solutions we create a green software community and ecosystem in Berlin.

Our goal is to shape the industry for the better in terms of using software in a sustainable way.
We strongly believe in the positive impact of digitalization. But we believe it must be done responsibly with awareness of consumption and with strong planning to avoid rebound effects.

Therefore we create tools to measure the energy use of software in CI-Build-Pipelines, VMs, Containers and User Desktop environments.
All of our core software is Free and Open-Source to be used by anyone.

Our flagship work is an [open-source green software toolchain](https://github.com/green-coding-solutions/green-metrics-tool) that lets you quantify the energy consumption of arbitrary software in typical real world usage scenarios.

&nbsp;

### What you will be working on:
You will be working with our team to create tools to measure the energy use of software and (drumroll please) actually MEASURE software :)

This may include setting up and measuring Bare Metal systems, AI models, Cloud environments, build-chains, CI/CD pipelines, Virtual Machines and more.

The work at Green Coding for our toolchain covers an extensive scope where you come into contact with a lot of tools that may be new to you. However, we supply an extensive onboarding and enough time to learn these tools if you are not already familiar with them.

Have a look at our GitHub Repository to get an overview of our tools: https://github.com/green-coding-solutions

Also check out the documentation for our flagship tool to get an impression of it: https://docs.green-coding.io/

### How your typical week looks like

When working at Green Coding Solutions GmbH as an engineer, the work is quite different from traditional coding jobs.

Accurate energy measurements of software is still a hard engineering problem and thus your work entails not only plain writing code according to a specification.

Many already established measurement solutions do not work in Cloud environment and usually we have to find ways how to still get the best possible data.

Some typical work items are:
- Architecture planning for benchmarking software
- reading Computer Science papers, articles and proof-of-concept code
- Evaluating other energy and carbon tooling
- creating prototypes to understand and evaluate new approaches
- creating algorithms and / or heuristics to reflect energy usage of hardware components
- contributing to other open source projects

We really like this creative and architectural process and believe you will do too :)

Your concrete coding work will be mostly on Linux systems writing either Python, Javascript or C Code.
Typically when measuring architectures, applications or software libraries this means creating a demo application with them.

To get an idea how this would look like have a look at our [repository for demo applications](https://github.com/green-coding-solutions/example-applications) (mostly web applications at the moment) and our documentation on [Example applications](https://docs.green-coding.io/docs/prologue/example-applications/) and [containerization of applications](https://docs.green-coding.io/docs/measuring/containerizing-applications/).
Also check out our [Case Studies]({{< relref path="case-studies" >}}), [CO2 Formulas for digital products]({{< relref path="co2-formulas" >}}) and our [Green Metrics Dashboard](https://metrics.green-coding.io) to get an idea of how the raw metrics will be presented.

Most of our tooling is written in script languages like Python or Node. Most of the low-level measurement software is written in C.


### Your qualification:

We believe the role is best filled with 5+ years experience as a professional software developer.

#### This is the skillset we believe is very helpful to have:
- Container systems (docker, podman or similar)
- Concepts of Virtualization (VMs)
- Basic understanding and experience with cloud infrastructure (AWS / Google Cloud / Azure / Kubernetes)
- Linux subsystem concepts for containerization (cgroups, namespaces, procfs, sysfs)
- End-to-End Testing Tools (Selenium, Codeception, Playwright or similar)
- CI-Pipelines (GitHub actions preferred)
- At least 1 year experience in Python
- Basic understanding of modern computer achitectures such as microprocessor design, machine registers, asssembly representation of code, microprocessor instructions etc.
- At least entry level experience in reading, writing and adapting C code or very good with ChatGPT :)
- Independently working on a project
- Product focused development

#### Non-Tech Skills:
- German fluency: C2 or native speaker
- Ability and willingness to give talks about green software
- Ability and willingness to write in-depth blog articles about green software
- (Optional): Working and publishing academic papers about green software

However if you are not too familiar with some of the skills mentioned above but feel confident you can learn them in a short time, also do not hesitate to apply.

&nbsp;

### Our place in the green software ecosystem

The green software community is a very friendly and uncompetetive bunch.

Here is a list of befriended organizations and communities we work with or contribute to:
- [KDE Eco](https://eco.kde.org/)
- [The Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/)
- [SDIA](https://sdialliance.org)
- HTW Berlin


### Working hours and pay

The job is possible as part-time or full-time.

Please include your expected salary and part-time/full-time preference in your email.

&nbsp;

### Home-office or in office?

We only offer home office and do not have a fixed office. However we semi-regularly meet in Berlin and also have on-site client appointments in Berlin that you should be able to attend.

There is no fixed time amount expected, but being in Berlin should be possible on request up to at least 3 days per month.

&nbsp;

### How to apply
Just shoot us an email at jobs@green-coding.io with a quick intro and why you would like to join our team.

Please also include a quick comment regarding the aforementioned skills.

Also very interesting for us is if you have any current experience with sustainable software design and / or what drives your interest in the field.

A link to your LinkedIn and GitHub profile is usually helpful.


There is no need for formal documents. If you want to send them however, feel free to attach them.
