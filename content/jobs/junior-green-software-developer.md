title: "Junior Green Software Developer"
description: "Open role for Junior Green Software Developer at Green Coding Berlin GmbH to work on sustainable software."
draft: true
---

At Green Coding Berlin we create a green software community and ecosystem in Berlin. 

Our goal is to shape the industry for the better in terms of using software in a sustainable way.
We strongly believe in the positive impact of digitalization. But we believe it must be done responsibly with awareness of consumption and 
with strong planning to avoid rebound effects.

Therefore we create tools to measure the energy use of software in CI-Build-Pipelines, VMs, Containers and User Desktop environments.
All of our software is Free and Open-Source Software to be used by anyone.

Our flagship work is an [open-source green software toolchain](https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/green-metrics-tool) that lets you quantify the energy consumption of arbitrary software in typical real world usage scenarios.

&nbsp;

### What you will be working on:

You will be working with our team to create tools to measure the energy use of software and (drumroll please) actually MEASURE software :)

As a junior developer, your work will be mainly developing sample applications and creating use-cases and comparisons of how people can relate to the energy consumption of software.

See examples in our [Case Studies](https://www.green-coding.berlin/case-studies), our [Example Applications](https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/example-applications) and our [Green Metrics Dashboard](https://metrics.green-coding.berlin)

### How your typical week looks like

When working at Green Coding Berlin GmbH as an engineer, the work is quite different from traditional coding jobs.

Working in CO2 measurement of software is currently still a very academic profession. Therefore our team does a lot of research and writing prototypes, tests and tools.

You, as a Junior Developer, will start out on a more guided path and begin with learning to use our tools and create sample applications.

You will take part in the team meetups, where the whole team meets and presents current approaches, new ideas and concepts that we all evaluate and iterate together. We do this 1-2 times a week and apart from that are usually home-office first.

We really like this creative and architectural process and believe you will do too :)


### Your qualification:

We believe the role is best filled with at least 6-12 months experience as a professional software developer. 

This is the skillset we think is very helpful to have:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript ES6
- Framework development in Javascript (React, Vue.js, Svelte or similar)
- Databases (MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite or similar)
- Hosting providers (Cloudflare Pages, Digital Ocean, Heroku or similar)
- At least around a 6-12 months experience in using one of these programming languages: Node.JS / Javascript or Python or PHP

Spoken language in the team is English. But we are a mixed group of English and German speakers.

### Our place in the green software ecosystem

The green software community is a very friendly and uncompetetive bunch.

Here is a list of befriended organizations and communities we work with or contribute to:
- [KDE Eco](https://eco.kde.org/)
- [The Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/)
- Ironhack Berlin 
- WBS Coding School Berlin

### Working hours and pay

The job is possible as part-time or full-time.

Please include your expected salary and part-time/full-time preference in your email.

&nbsp;

### Home-office or in office?
We are a home-office first company, but we do not offer remote work. You have to be based in Berlin.

The reason is that we have a strong focus on weekly in-person creative meetups.

So expect 1-2 days in the office per week for 4-5 hours each.

During the onboarding however, which can take around 1-2 months, we usually start for the first weeks with 5 office days a week and then move our standard home-office mode asap.

&nbsp;

### How to apply
Just shoot us an email at jobs@green-coding.berlin with a quick intro and why you would like to join our team.

Please also include a quick comment on your skills regarding the aforementioned skills.

Also very interesting for us is if you have any current experience with sustainable software design and / or what drives your interest in the field.

A link to your LinkedIn and Github profile is usually helpful.

There is no need for formal documents. If you want to send them however, feel free to attach them.
