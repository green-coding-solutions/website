## 🚀 The Blue Angel for resource- and energy-efficient software products
#### Now with Green Coding Solutions at your side! 🌱

💻 Software is the heart of the digital world, but did you know that it also contributes significantly to resource and energy consumption? 
Digital emissions are now as high as those of all air traffic. That's why the Blue Angel certifies resource- and energy-efficient software products to make sustainable solutions visible. 

With us - Green Coding Solutions - at your side, you can now embark on the path to Blue Angel certification and make your software product a pioneer of sustainable digitalization.

### 🌍 Why should you apply for the Blue Angel?
1. **Making sustainability visible**\
The Blue Angel identifies software that uses hardware resources particularly sparingly and indicates its energy consumption. This means that your software is more transparent and environmentally friendly than the competition and makes a valuable contribution to conserving resources.
2. **Transparency that creates trust**\
With the Blue Angel on board, you create clarity. Your application must be measurable - this makes your path to sustainability comprehensible for everyone and proves your efforts to be environmentally friendly. You will not only be perceived by your users as efficient, but also as responsible.
3. **Extend the service life of hardware**\
Your software ensures that hardware can be used for longer instead of being replaced prematurely - a win-win situation: resources are conserved and electronic waste is reduced. Your software stays on course for the future - with foresight.
4. **Reusability**\
The Blue Angel for resource- and energy-efficient software products requires that your software can export user data in a standard format and that the code is either open source or disclosed at the end of the software's distribution. Requirements are also placed on the documentation and modularity of the software. 
5. **Independently tested and certified**\
The Blue Angel requires special expertise, so an additional auditor and a sophisticated measurement setup are necessary. We at Green Coding Solutions can support you either as an auditor or as a measurement laboratory. Our job is to ensure that your software meets the strict requirements of the Blue Angel.

### ✨ What makes the Blue Angel so unique for software?
🔵 Focus on efficiency: Your software is audited with regard to its energy and resource consumption. With this certification, you can clearly demonstrate that your software works in such a way that it can also run on older hardware resources and can continue to be used even after the end of software distribution.

🔵 Trust through transparency: All relevant information about the energy and resource efficiency of your software is made publicly available. Openness creates trust - among customers, partners and users.

🔵 Less is more: Efficient software means fewer resources are wasted and no unnecessary hardware upgrades are required. Fewer upgrades = lower costs = more environmental awareness.
