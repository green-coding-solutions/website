## What Does the Certification Process Involve?

The path to certification is very formalized and involves handing in the following documents:

- Annex 1 - Overview of software product and applicant 
- Annex 2 - Measurement results of performance and energy metrics
- Annex 3 - Measurement data series and thorough description of measurement setup and configurations
- Annex 4 - Statement about used data formats in your software
- Annex 5 - Statement about API documentations, source code and licenses of your software
- Annex 6 - Statement about freedom from advertising, deinstallation and continuity of your software
- Annex 7 - The public downloadable document giving an overview over minimal system requirements, measurement setup and measurement results

This rigorous but transparent process ensures that certified software truly meets environmental and quality standards—backed by government-recognized oversight.

The most work in the certification process lies in the proper setup and procurement of the compliant benchmarking infrastructure including making reproducible measurements and representativ usage scenarios (Nutzungs-Szenarien [DE]).
 
### Streamlined application process
 
With the [Green Metrics Tool](/products/green-metrics-tool), also [certified under the Blue Angel](https://www.blauer-engel.de/de/produkte/green-metrics-tool), we have created an open source solution that streamlines this process. Additionally we offer our server infrastructure as a Software as a Service including a paid add-on to the open source tool that can specifcally make Blue Angel compatible exports.

Our tools auto-generate the application annexes. It also seamlessly imports measurement data from the Green Metrics Tool into the official application template. Built-in text suggestions and templates drastically reduce effort for companies so you can focus on sustainable product design and we work on making your sustainability efforts visible.

### Automated, reliable and audit-read

One core intention of the Blue Angel is to motivate and empower companies to learn about their software energy consumption. The Green Metrics Tool takes an extra step here and tracks your performance and sustainability over time. More importantly, it is a detailed analysis tool that helps to detect energy inefficiencies and provides detailed recommendations to decrease unnecessary emissions. Our tool also ensures every software update automatically triggers performance and energy-efficiency tests so that companies are aware of energy consumption of new feature updates.

This tracking over time also enables you easliy extend and renew your certification after one year with new and updated energy values (Required by the Blue Angel Award criteria).
 
### Automated, reliable and audit-ready
The tests are run on our cluster systems, which ensure a stable documented testing environment. It is also compatible with a wide range of applications including Linux, Windows, Mobile and even AI applications.

### Transparent and compliant
Benchmark against industry standards using your own existing units and export reports directly from our interactive dashboard, such that they are ready for submission.

### Try before you commit
We know we are making big claims, but we will leave it to you to truly understand the magic of our tool and how we can help you simplify the process. You can use our free open-source version to explore our capabilities.

One of Green Coding Solutions’ objectives is to reduce energy emissions in software and we believe that the first step in doing so is to measuring and quantifying these emissions in the first place. 

We ourselves have been certified with the Blue Angel software so we know how rigorous and time-consuming the process can be. Our tools help you ensure that the certification is simple, accurate and efficient.


We have a dedicated team that believes that the Blue Angel Certification process is a key step to realising our vision for a more responsible ICT industry. What we can offer you outside of the free version is a dedicated team that understands the process inside and out and is committed to automating the process as much as possible for you.
