The first step in reducing your software carbon footprint is to understand where it is coming from and why it is your responsibility to lower it.

We go with clients through the journey of first understanding the background of software carbon emissions and then the accredited methodologies to report and assess software carbon emissions.

            <p>Software carbon emissions stem from the fact that software runs on infrastructure that on the one hand consumes energy and on the other hand has to be manufactured in very carbon intensive processes.</p>
            <p>The effective user of that infrastructure is responsible for that carbon emissons and thus has the obligation to reduce it as much as technically and economically possible.</p>
            <p>To implement business goals and KPIs it is key to understand where the biggest sources of carbon emissions lie (scope 3 upstream, downstream or even in scope 2) and where the biggest levers are.</p>
            <p>Our consulting offer focuses on key business goals and product needs with a focus on carbon efficiency and carbon reduction. The first step is to incorporate carbon metrics into central DevOps, Engineering and also Management Dashboards to enable businesses to act effectively in reducting software carbon emissions.</p>

            <p>Companies face increased challenges for reporting under the CSRD or the british reporting scheme which comes into effect by 2024.</p>
            <p>ISO 14001 is the norm for lifecycle assessment that also supports assessments for digital producuts.</p>
            <p>In order to leverage the ISO 14001 a supporting framework, the GHG protocol is needed, which supplies the necessary boundaries and attributional methods to quantify a software product.</p>
            <p>For non-reporting use, but rather internal operations we bring the SCI standard into your team and show <a href="https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/use-case-automated-sci-measurements-with-green-metrics-tool">how a software can be quantified and assessed with this methodology</a></p>

            <p>On premise systems are often very heterogenous and contain a lot of legacy components. To understand their software carbon emissions we leverage carbon databases and reporting heuristics to understand your software carbon footprint</p>
            <p>Cloud infrastructure is often more homogenouse but lacks very often with offical vendor data so that reporting-ready estimations are needed.</p>
            <p>Here we employ a mix of official accredited databases and state of the art machine-learning estimation models combined with seasoned open-source products to get an overview over your architecture.</p>
