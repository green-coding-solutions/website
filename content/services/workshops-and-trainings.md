The first step in reducing your software carbon footprint is to understand where it is coming from and why it is your responsibility to lower it.

We go with clients through the journey of first understanding the background of software carbon emissions and then the accredited methodologies to report and assess software carbon emissions.

            <p>Software carbon emissions stem from the fact that software runs on infrastructure that on the one hand consumes energy and on the other hand has to be manufactured in very carbon intensive processes.</p>
            <p>The effective user of that infrastructure is responsible for that carbon emissons and thus has the obligation to reduce it as much as technically and economically possible.</p>
            <p>To implement business goals and KPIs it is key to understand where the biggest sources of carbon emissions lie (scope 3 upstream, downstream or even in scope 2) and where the biggest levers are.</p>
            <p>Our consulting offer focuses on key business goals and product needs with a focus on carbon efficiency and carbon reduction. The first step is to incorporate carbon metrics into central DevOps, Engineering and also Management Dashboards to enable businesses to act effectively in reducting software carbon emissions.</p>
