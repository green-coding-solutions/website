Acting and reducing digital emissions in software happens through using less software, changing and optimizing running software and bringing new analytics and reporting software in.

We develop [industry wide used state of the art open source software](/#projects) and also change and optimize carbon legacy software for clients.

            <p>Understanding how much your product is using in terms of CO2 is not only key for optimizations and reporting, but also an important marketing and transparency gain.</p>
            <p>To make certain claims about the carbon efficiency or even carbon neutrality of your product it is important that real time metrics of the application are present in a very granular layer.</p>
            <p>We benchmark and profile your application with our open source tooling and automate the profiling for every commit that you check in - DevOps ready.</p>
            <p>Carbon transparent applications report this values typically as an SCI value. We have done numerous of these profilings already and also submit use-cases to the Green Software Foundation for open source tools.</p>
            <p>Application carbon profiles can be used to drive optimizations, drive team and talent engagement and for external communication like reportings and marketing.</p>

            <p>Many applications out there still work without any energy or cabon optimizations.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it is best to integrate some new carbon aware techniques like time-shifting, load-shifting, demand-shaping, power-capping, os-tuning to optimizte such a carbon-legacy application.</p>
            <p>In other cases it is more helpful to make architectural changes like integrate dynamic scaling, libary-swap-outs, language-swap-outs or others.</p>
            <p>For every of these techniques it is important to have good understanding of the development cost but also the expected carbon savings beforehand.</p>
            <p>We help with our expertise planning and excuting such an optimization process to make it most effective and efficient.</p>
