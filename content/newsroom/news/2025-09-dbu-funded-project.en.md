We are excited to announce that we are part of the CASO project, which is funded by the German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU).

The CASO project aims to make software development more energy and CO₂ efficient. It integrates technologies directly into the development process to give developers transparency about their software's energy consumption and CO₂ emissions. By combining measurements, data analysis, and AI-supported recommendations, developers can make informed decisions to create more sustainable software. The project intends to highlight optimization possibilities for configuration, algorithms, and operating system settings.
