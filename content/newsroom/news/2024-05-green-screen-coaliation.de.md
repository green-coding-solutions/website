We are proud and happy 🤩 to announce that Green Coding Solutions GmbH is one of this year's winners of the [Green Screen Catalyst Fund](https://greenscreen.network/en/blog/announcing-the-new-catalyst-fund-awardees/) ! As one of 15 companies selected from over 350 applications!

This will enable and further support the development of one of our tools for evaluating energy consumption in the Linux kernel - and thus the insight and quantification of the energy costs of software at process level.

Thank you to the Green Screen Coalition 🌱 (Ariadne, Ford Foundation, Internet Society Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, Green Web Foundation, Critical Infrastructure Lab and the Mercator Foundation) for funding this pioneering fund 🙏.
