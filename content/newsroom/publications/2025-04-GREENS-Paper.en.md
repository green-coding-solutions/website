The increasing energy consumption of software and hardware systems has become a significant concern due to its environmental impact and operational costs. While operating systems like Windows and macOS have proprietary, undocumented energy analytics functionality, this feature is still lacking in Linux. In this paper we introduce PowerLetrics, an open-source framework designed to monitor and analyze power consumption metrics on a process level on Linux.
