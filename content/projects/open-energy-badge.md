The **Open Energy Badge** is a project where we propose a new badge for Github Repositories that informs about the cost
of:

- Running the tests in the project
- How much a certain activity costs (ex. the cost of an API call)
- How much building the static website costs
- etc.

It is created automatically by our [Green Metrics Tool](/projects/green-metrics-tool) and can freely be used.

The energy metrics created come in different metric types, depending on if you tested it locally on your dev system
or on our [hosted demo instance](https://metrics.green-coding.io)  with option to submit software for measuring.

See the badge in action for instance on our [documentation repository](https://github.com/green-coding-services/documentation) where you can directly see how much the building
costs of the static pages where.
