We have teamed with **Chris Adams** from **The Green Web Foundation** to co-host host another Meetup for the Green Software Community in Berlin.

## Part#1 The Green Web Foundation Talk
Chris will give a share what you need to know about how digital infrastructure is powered, and how to make the greenest choices for powering your services.
He will also talk about the lastest works of The Green Web Foundation and their mission to create a fossil free internet.

## Part#2 Green Coding Berlin
In the second part of the Meetup we as Green Coding Berlin will be presenting our recent works on our Open Source Toolchain (AGPLv3) to measure the carbon impact of your Software: [The Green Metrics Tool](https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/green-metrics-tool)
We will also walk you through the approach to measure your infrastructure and software with our tool and how you can use it in your own project.

## Casual Pizzas & Community
Afterwards, as usual, we will hang out and chat. There is also time and space to present you Green Software project in a casual round afterwards.

So join us and let's grow the Green Software community in Berlin!

**Location:** The Meetup is inside Betahaus on the first floor. We will keep the door open, so just go up one flight.

**Contact:** If you want to shoot us some questions or infos beforehand or anything just write an email to arne@green-coding.berlin
