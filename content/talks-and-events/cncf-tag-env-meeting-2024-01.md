We had the opportunity to present at the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation - TAG Environmental Sustainability](https://tag-env-sustainability.cncf.io/) about energy and carbon measurement of open source software.

In the presentation we go over all the feature that the Green Metrics Tool provides including:
- Energy measurement
- Carbon measurement
- Embodied carbon
- Modular architecture
- Statistical comparisons
- Timeline view
- DevOps Integrations
- Optimizations
- and much more

Find the Youtube Video under the link below. Also if you want to see all features and a live demo of the tool go to our [Green Metrics Tool project]({{<relref path="products/green-metrics-tool" >}}) page.
