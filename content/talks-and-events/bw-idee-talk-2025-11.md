As part of the BWIdee educational and competitive program for students, a series of lectures on digitalization are offered. These lectures explore the interfaces with ecological, economic, and social sustainability.

In a 1.5-hour interactive lecture, the topic of "Green Coding" will be presented.

The target audience is intentionally broad, encompassing both technical students and those from the social sciences or humanities.

We presented a lecture format that provides inspiration and ideas for designing ecologically sustainable digital products such as software.

The lecture showcases examples and tools that make the topic tangible and offer participants the opportunity to directly apply it to their own projects afterward.

The format will be rounded off with interactive questions to enliven the lecture and provide an opportunity to assess and reflect on one's own knowledge in this area.

Since our strong suit is tools and hands-on learning we presented a plethora of ready use tools to get your work on softwar sustainability going:

- [GCS Website Tester](https://website-tester.green-coding.io)
- Python tools for easy home energy measurement
- [PowerHOG]({{< relref path="/products/power-hog" >}}) for measuring energy consumption on laptops
- Electricity Maps - How green is the electricity we use?
- AI Energy Tools - Token Count Chrome Extension
- AI Energy Tools - [Green-Coding.ai](https://www.green-coding.ai)
