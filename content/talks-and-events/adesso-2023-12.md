This time we have invited [Yelle Lieder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lieder/) from [adesso](https://www.adesso.de/de/) to speak about their [ECO:DIGIT](https://gi.de/aktuelles/projekte/eco-digit) project.

In his talk, Yelle Lieder (adesso) will introduce the ECO:DIGIT research project. ECO:DIGIT started in summer 23 and over the course of three years has the goal of coming closer to a holistic and scientifically based life cycle assessment of digital systems.
In a short presentation, you will learn about the vision of the project, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection.

You will of course also learn what advantages the project promises compared to existing solutions and what opportunities the open-source community in particular has to participate.

Afterwards we will be speaking on some open source tooling to create an automated SCI score for your software.
The [SCI](https://sci-guide.greensoftware.foundation/) is a metric by the Green Software Foundation that shows the carbon efficiency of a software product.

The [Green Metrics Tool](https://github.com/green-coding-services/green-metrics-tool/), an automated and open source tool developend by us, Green Coding Solutions, allows for such an automated measurement.
We will talk briefly about the tool functionalities and then perspectives how make software comparable according to their carbon efficiency and how companies and developers can leverage this to write sustainable software.
