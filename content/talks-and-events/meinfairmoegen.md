Money makes the world go round: Financial markets still finance an economy that is on average not fit to mitigate or even adapt to climate change. Who wants to invest for a decent pension faces difficulties to find out where the money goes in the end. Aiming for impact to make the world better, is even harder. MyFairMoney/ MeinFairMögen is starting here: presenting independent information on climate performance of financial products, helping consumers to choose more climate friendly products.

Meet projects which have already set their mission to fight the climate change in a particular way.

Get to know what they do and why they are doing it.
