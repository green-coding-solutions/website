**The Green Coding Meetup is finally back! (DE/EN)**

And we have great speakers, a great location, great food ... basically everything is great about the Meetup. :) - Also - we have a very special suprise and will give away free tickets to the WeAreDevelopers World Congress in Berlin!!!! (see details on event page)

The [Bundesverband Green Software](https://www.bundesverband-green-software.de/) has teamed up with the Green Coding Meetup and many great partners (see details on event page).

Talks will be in English preferred but might switch to German if we have no English speaking folks present.

For first-timers: Typically we have 50/50 DE/EN folks present, so for chit-chat after you will always find some language
that you are comfortable with.

## Agenda:
- 18:30 Doors open
- 18:45 Talk #1: Blauer Engel für Software (DE/EN)
- 19:15 Small break
- 19:25 Talk #2 - Carbon Aware Computing (DE/EN)
- 20:00 - Enjoying ourselves with lovely Green Coding chit chat

### Talk #1 - Blauer Engel für Software
The Blauer Engel für Software is the official ecolabel introduced by the German Umweltbundesamt and it certifies software products that are more energy and resource-efficient. In 2024, the scope of the label expanded from just desktop software to software on mobile devices and service software.

How will such a label benefit you and how can you ensure your software is sustainable and get certified too?
The talk will walk you through the process of getting certified, which would include measuring how sustainable your software is with the help of the Green Metrics Tool and how you can proceed to fulfil the criteria for the Blauer Engel für Software. We will also share our insights into website measurements and the vast gap in energy consumption.

To ensure that you know what to expect with the certification, we will also share a case study on Nextcloud, which has also been certified with the Blauer Engel für Software label. We will talk about relevant data and setup that was needed for the certification.

### Talk #2 - Carbon Aware Computing
To meet the demands of climate-conscious software development, we need to go beyond traditional optimisation strategies like server utilisation and dynamic scaling.
But the good news is that we don’t have to reinvent the wheel, as Green Software Development design patterns already exist. Enter carbon-aware computing where you align software resource usage with the availability of low-carbon energy.

This talk explores two key approaches:
• Time-shifting: scheduling flexible tasks (e.g., batch jobs) when renewable energy is most available.
• Demand shaping: adapting real-time workloads to current energy conditions.

We’ll demonstrate how these patterns can be implemented using Azure and Kubernetes, including how to “shed” load, dynamically limit scaling based on CO₂ intensity, and source reliable energy predictions, which will all be illustrated through live demos.
