Many teams within our community understand the necessity of integrating their digital products into their sustainability strategies. However, in a series of recent interviews with product teams, we revealed a disconnect between awareness and action. Sounds familiar? The reasons, though straightforward, pose significant challenges:

- Development hurdles: Building digital products is inherently time-consuming and expensive, leading to a culture of "scoping" and prioritizing core business needs. This can unintentionally exclude sustainability features.

- Knowledge gap: PMs and sustainability managers often lack the technical expertise to articulate relevant solutions for their specific tech stack and codebase, with devs responding with the "you-have-no-idea-what-you're-talking-about" eyebrow raise

In this 90-minute learning session, we are aiming to bridge that gap and empower both sides to bring the topic back into your next sprint planning!

### What you'll gain:

- ðŸ¤“ Actionable steps: Dive into practical, technical examples to improve your product's environmental footprint

- ðŸŽ¯ Product manager playbook: Learn how to build, advocate for, and workshop sustainability initiatives within your product team.

- Expert insights: Learn from two leading voices:

**Arne Tarara**: Founder & CEO of Green Coding Berlin, an Open Source collective guiding clients towards sustainable software development.

**Timo MÃ¼ller**: Co-Founder and Product Lead at lfca.earth, bringing a broader product perspective to the conversation.

Don't miss this opportunity to connect and discuss with like-minded individuals, gain actionable knowledge, and learn to make a real impact on our planet.
