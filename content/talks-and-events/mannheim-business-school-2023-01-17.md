We are invited to give a guest lecture at the [Mannehim Business School](https://www.mannheim-business-school.com/de/) about Green Coding.

The [Indian Institute of Management](https://www.linkedin.com/company/indian-institute-of-management-lucknow/) is visiting Mannheim Business School in January for 
a study trip to hear some lectures about sustainability and sustainabile management.

 We are delighted to have been invited to give two talks in this period:

- Sustainability in the digital world: European perspective
- Understanding software carbon emissions and saving potentials for management
