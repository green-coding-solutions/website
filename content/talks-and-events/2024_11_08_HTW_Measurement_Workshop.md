[Prof. Dr. Volker Wohlgemuth](https://www.htw-berlin.de/hochschule/personen/person/?eid=3355) has invited us to a measurement Workshop at the HTW Berlin.

We are extremely delighted to having had the opportunity to present the concept of understanding and measuring software carbon emissions to some young and information hungry students.

The workshop had a 1.5 hour format where we first went through all the nitty-gritties of how and why software emits CO2.

After that we took a hands-on approach to use our [Eco-CI](/products/eco-ci) tool to measure the energy cost of GitHub and GitLab pipelines.


Thanks again to [Prof. Dr. Volker Wohlgemuth](https://www.htw-berlin.de/hochschule/personen/person/?eid=3355) and her student group for having us!

Small marketing pitch: In case you are also interested to have a workshop or some training for you team contact us. We are open for hire!
