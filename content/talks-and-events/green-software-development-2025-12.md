We are invited to talk at the Meetup of the Green Software Development group!

## Details from their Meetup page

The **Blue Angel** is the most prestigious environmental label in Germany and has been available for software for over a year. Our group has been following this label for quite some time, and now we're taking a closer look at its practical application.

**Nextcloud** was the first cloud software to receive the Blue Angel. What was the process like, why did Nextcloud apply, and what impact does the label have on the company and its customers?

Our guests are Nina from Nextcloud, Phillip from Oktobit (auditor), and Arne from Green Coding Solutions (measurement body). In this talk, we'll learn:

- What is the Blue Angel and how does the certification process work in detail?
- What motivates companies to pursue certification?
- What impact does it have on customers?
- How is the measurement carried out, and what needs to be documented?

The evening will cover the Blue Angel in detail and provide initial case studies.
