## What is Green IO ?

Apidays Munich and the Green IO podcast have partnered to bring you the first Green IO conference for the DACH region, packed with the latest insights from thought leaders in Tech Sustainability and hands-on feedback from practitioners scaling Green IT. 

Great hopes have been placed in IT and Digital Technologies to support our transition towards a low-carbon economy, but the digital sector itself emits as many greenhouse gases as the world's entire road freight. Let's make sure we clean our own house while helping to make the world a better place!
