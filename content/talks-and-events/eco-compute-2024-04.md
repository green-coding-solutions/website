EcoCompute aims to address the current issue of energy and resource consumption of digital infrastructures with a new approach:

We want to bring together hardware designers, software developers, data center operators and also IT project planners to understand intersectional barriers and implementation hurdles.

So far environmental concerns have mostly been addressed in siloed domains or solutions have been suggested that could not be implemented in production scenarios due to privacy or client concerns.

EcoCompute aspires to surface new working solutions and advance sustainability in digital technology.
