ecoCompute is our yearly conference about sustainbility in digital tech.

Here we shine a spotlight on the often invisible environmental footprint of our digital world. While the carbon cost of flying or manufacturing is alredy recognized by many, the emissions caused by inefficient software, data-intensive applications, and energy-hungry infrastructure remain largely hidden. 

ecoCompute brings together developers, researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders to confront this blindspot head-on with talks, workshops, meeting friends, networking and much more!
