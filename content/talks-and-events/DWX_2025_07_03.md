Our CTO Didi Hoffmann is scheduled to give a talk about "Software sustainability certifications â€“ Blue Angel (Blauer Engel) for software" at the DWX conference
in Mannheim on 3rd of July.

## Talk details
Software sustainbility is a hot topic in current discussions around increasing energy and carbon cost of our digital life.

In 2024 the Umweltbundesamt has released new certification guidelines for their renonwned "Blauer Engel" regarding software products.

In this talk I present how these criterias work, which software can be tested and what advantages certifcate holders, respectively the company and developers of software, can expect.

Furthermore I will present hands-on experience on our work for having created the certification documents for the first two softwar products under the new certification guidelines and also many experiences and recommendations on how to measure and certify your software under the Blue Angel award criterias.
