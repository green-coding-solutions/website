In his talk about "Sustainability (through) IT" Thomas will give an overview of different approaches and possibilities on how IT can reduce resource consumption and CO2 emissions by predicting and balancing supply and demand in volatile markets that usually see a lot of overproduction and resource loss.

In the second part of his talk, he will show how IT itself could be made more sustainable and that ecological and economical interests and goals are not always a contradiction but closer together than many people think.

Thomas Bendig, Head of Innovation and Technology Board of adesso SE, worked for the Fraunhofer Group Information and Communication Technology as a research coordinator and managing director. Due to his experience, he is an expert in the field of IT and digital sustainable transformation in a wide range of industries.</p>
