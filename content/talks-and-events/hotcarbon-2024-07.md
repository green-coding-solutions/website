HotCarbon aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in computer and networked systems to engage in a lively discussion around sustainability throughout the entire computing lifecycle, focusing on both the operational and embodied impact of computer systems.

We handed in a paper called **Improving Carbon Emissions of Federated Large Language Model Inference through Classification of Task-Specificity** and will be presenting in the online program.
