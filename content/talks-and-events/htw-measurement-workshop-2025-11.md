[Prof. Dr. Volker Wohlgemuth](https://www.htw-berlin.de/hochschule/personen/person/?eid=3355) has invited us to a measurement Workshop at the HTW Berlin.

The workshop is now an established series we give for new students in the Winter Semester.
We introduce topics like software carbon emissions and how to properly benchmark a software for energy consumption.

Then we hands on dive into topics like measuring CI/CD pipelines (for instance with [Eco-CI](/products/eco-ci) ) or steering sustainable software development through integrating measurements directly into *git* workflows


Thanks again to [Prof. Dr. Volker Wohlgemuth](https://www.htw-berlin.de/hochschule/personen/person/?eid=3355) and her student group for having us!

Small marketing pitch: In case you are also interested to have a workshop or some training for you team contact us. We are open for hire!
