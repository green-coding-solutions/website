We help you to transform your software to a sustainable product. 

Scroll down and see how we work with companies in our 5 stage approach. 

We are [regular speaker at conferences and industry symposiums](/#nav-meetups), developing
[open source industry advancing container native carbon measurement tools](/projects/green-metrics-tool) as well as
[state of the art carbon pipeline tooling](/projects/eco-ci), active advocates and consultants for energy and carbon transparency
through certifications like the [Blauer Engel f√ºr Software](https://www.blauer-engel.de/de/produktwelt/ressourcen-und-energieeffiziente-softwareprodukte) or our [Energy-ID](/projects/energy-id) project.

Some of our recent recognized works in research include
[tailored open source machine models for energy estimation in cloud environments](/projects/cloud-energy), published positional
papers and academical papers for software lifecycle assessment and software energy measurement, work on
[Software-Lifecycle-Assessment](https://publication2023.bits-und-baeume.org/#book/38) with developer tools to be released later this year and cited
[case studies for energy savings and optimizations](/case-studies).

How we work
{{</ greenblock >}}

We usually work with clients in a five module program. However for clients who are already advanced in their sustainability journey we provide the modules separately according to clients needs.

So also only a measurement & optimize workshop to bring your developers up to code with current Green Coding techniques or carbon-optimizing your CI/CD pipelines or customer facing websites is part of our portfolio.

            <p>Software emits CO2 through it's own operation, by using energy still based on fossil fuels, but also indirectly through the embodied carbon of the hardware reservation. Also modern systems run in datacenters with expensive cooling, land-use etc. - See a deeper dive into the topic in our <a href="/about">About</a> section</p>
            <p>We use the methodologies based on research and industry standard practices (GHG Protocol / ISO 14001 / Green Software Foundation) and analyse all your infrastructure and identify targets for immediate and later analysis.</p>

              <p>After understanding your digital carbon emissions using them transparently is <strong>key</strong>.Internally as we as externally.</p>
            <p>This begins with creating KPIs internally, setting carbon budgets and bringing it to all team dashboards.</p>
            <p>Externally this includes reportings to vendoers, clients and also regulatory bodies.</p>
            <p>We help you create reports (Scope 1,2, 3) for European's CSRD, GHG Protocol, Green Software Foundation SCI, ISO 14001 and many more.</p>
            <p>Depending on the size of your company it is helpful to first create reportings with internally used accounting tools and switch to real-time reportings and software integrations later.</p>
