In this meetup Michael will introduce us to GreenOps, a hands-on approach to improve the carbon footprint of all kind of applications running in the Cloud.

GreenOps has the goal to support companies accelerating their sustainability strategy and transform towards a carbon-aware engineering culture.

Beside that, Michael guides us a bit through:
- Google’s strong sustainability strategy to become carbon free by 2030 and
- explains the most relevant best practices that every IT engineer or operations expert can apply to make an impact.
