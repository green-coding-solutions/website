We are invited to talk at the Meetup of the Green Software Development group!

## Details from their Meetup page

ðŸ“£ 2nd meetup in 2023: We are very happy to announce the next meeting of the Green Software Development Community.

Last time we focused on the challenge of putting research about sustainable software into practice. This time we will go one step further and will focus on best-practices and which tools can be applied in the real world.

This hybrid meetup will take place on Apr 25th, 2023 at the office of MaibornWolff GmbH at VoÃŸstr. 33, 10117 Berlin and remote (join online meeting).

People living around Munich can join our satellite event to attend remotely together from the Office of QAware GmbH in Munich.

Remote attendees can join anytime with the existing link and don't have to register as guest.

We're looking forward to see you there!

- 7:15 PM | "Tools and Best-Practices for Sustainable Software - An overview", Arne Tarara, Lead Engineer at Green Coding Berlin

#### Talk: Tools and Best-Practices for Sustainable Software - An overview

**Abstract:**

A typical question from developers when it comes to sustainable software is often:

- What are the best practices

- Which tools should I use

In this talk Arne will give an overview over some of the most relevant tools for sustainable software engineering and when to use them. One note ahead: There is not silver bullet :)

Also some "best practices" are presented but also pitfalls that come along with them.

Finally a summary is given which methods provide the most potential when it comes to understanding and reducing software energy consumption and why real benefits can only be achieved with "being less wasteful".
