Hey Green Coders!

We are partnering this month with [GfK](https://www.gfk.com/home) for our Meetup.

We are thrilled to announce our upcoming Green Coding and Infrastructure meet-up, which will take place on May 31st at the brand-new [GfK Berlin Office](https://goo.gl/maps/h8spxMqNZZoSUvX79). As a global player in the data insights industry, GfK is obviously keen to act and think future-oriented. Therefore, they are committed to sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint, and this event is part of GfK’s efforts to promote eco-friendliness in the tech industry.

The event is supposed to bring together like-minded professionals, developers, and enthusiasts who are passionate about green coding practices and want to make a positive impact on the environment. We will have two speaker slots for experts to share their insights, ideas, and experiences on green coding and sustainability in the tech industry.

### Agenda:

- 18.30 – 19.00: Welcome & free Snacks & Drinks
- 19.00 – 19.30: Green IT and sustainability in the Cloud
- 19.30 – 20.00: Understanding Software Carbon emissions
- As of 20.00 Q&A and Socializing

Bernhard Günther (Principal Site Reliability Engineer, GfK) will give a short presentation about **Green IT and sustainability in the Cloud** to feed an emerging discussion. As the cloud gives you a lot of freedom it also forces you to take the responsibility to plan your cloud infrastructure sustainable yourself.

Arne Tarara will share insights on **Understanding Software Carbon emissions**. Software uses no physical resources directly, but the underlying infrastructure. In order to help developers contribute to the worlds carbon neutral target it is key to understand where carbon emissions from software come from and how they can be identified. Arne, a software engineer from Open-Source company Green Coding Berlin, will give an overview over current models and frameworks for classifying and attributing software carbon share and current limitations with these approaches. He will present some Open-Source tools that make energy cost and carbon emissions visible for a developer to drive energy consumption and carbon emissions down.

In addition to the speakers, there will be enough time for networking and discussion among attendees. We encourage everyone to bring their own ideas and questions to share with the community.

We look forward to seeing you there and working together to create a more sustainable future through green coding and infrastructure practices!
