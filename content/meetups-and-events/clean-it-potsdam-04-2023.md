We are invited to speak at the [openXchange events](https://open.hpi.de/courses/cleanit2021/items/4YOS50CbwIdEkM4aQQ9zJF) from the HPI Clean IT team.

## Details

We present our open-source projects Eco CI to make energy consumption in CI/CD pipelines visible and the Green Metrics Tool which helps developers compare arbitrary software regarding its energy cost.

Arne Tarara works for Green Coding Berlin, which is a Berlin-based software company focused on creating open-source and measurements in the domain of software energy consumption. He has been working as a software developer for the last 16 years mainly in the web domain with a strong background in analytics and linear modeling.
