# Green Metrics Tool has been certified with the Blue Angel for Software Label

Big news: Our Green Metrics Tool just now also physically received the Blue Angel ecolabel for software after getting certified in 2024! 
That makes us one of just three software products in Germany to get this recognition — alongside Nextcloud Server and KDE's Okular.

The award was announced at a special event hosted by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment and the German Environment Agency, focused on _“Open Source and Blue Angel Software – A Sustainable Concept.”_ It brought together leaders from the public and private sectors, all talking about one thing: how we can make software more sustainable, transparent, and independent.

We’re proud to be part of the first wave setting this standard.

## Why we wanted to be one of the first

At Green Coding Solutions, we've always believed that software should work *with* the planet, not against it. But in the tech world, sustainability is often left out of the conversation — especially when it comes to code.

That’s why being one of the first tools to receive the Blue Angel for Software was a big deal for us. It’s not just about the recognition — it’s about showing that it *is* possible to build efficient, transparent, and responsible digital products. And that others can (and should) do it too.

## So, what is the Blue Angel for Software?

If you’re not familiar with it yet, the Blue Angel is Germany’s oldest and most trusted ecolabel. It’s usually seen on things like paper or electronics — but now, for the first time, it’s being awarded to software.

And that makes sense, because the ICT sector is responsible for somewhere between **1.8% and 3.8% of global carbon emissions** — about the same as the aviation industry. Yep, code really does have a carbon footprint.

The Blue Angel for Software makes that impact **visible and measurable**. To get certified, a software product has to show:

- It uses energy and hardware resources efficiently  
- It’s designed to **extend hardware lifespans** (no more unnecessary upgrades!)  
- It avoids things like forced updates or hidden data processing  
- It sticks to **open standards** and supports **user freedom**  
- And all of that has to be **transparent and verifiable**

## Why this matters for your company too

More and more companies are setting climate goals — but when it comes to digital products, many don’t yet have a clear way to measure or communicate their impact. The Blue Angel for Software helps change that.

Here’s how it can help you:

- **Build trust** with customers who are tired of greenwashing  
- **Attract talent** (especially younger workers who want to work for mission-driven companies)  
- Align your tech and sustainability teams around something concrete  
- Show you're serious about responsible innovation — not just saying the right things  

And since it’s backed by the German government, the Blue Angel isn’t just another green sticker. It’s a reliable, independent certification that signals: we’re doing this the right way.

## A step in the right direction

The award ceremony itself was a great reminder that we’re not alone in this. It was inspiring to hear from others who are also thinking critically about how we build software — and how we can make it better.

We’re hopeful that more and more companies will go for this label, and we’d love to see this become the norm, not the exception.

And if you’re interested in getting certified yourself? We’ve been through the process and are happy to help however we can. Find out more about [our services here](/services/blauer-engel/)


Because in the end, **sustainable software isn't just the future — it's already happening**.  
And yep, we still stand by it: **good code is green code**.
