Now just after announcing our public repo on with our website as HUGO source in it
, we are now also publishing our resources repo.

When we started to get an overview in the field of Green Coding and Green
Software Engineering we found a landscape of many solo coders / bloggers.

The resources are quite plenty, although very scattered and very different in
their quality.

In our repo we tried to condense this down to only the most valueable
ressources.

The repo contains an introductory README.md and from there on sub-folders with
categorised content.

The most helpful at this point are probably:

- [Green Software Engineering Web](https://github.com/green-coding-services/links-documents-resources/blob/main/Links/Green-Software-Engineering-Web.md)

- [Green Software Engineering Articles / Blogs / Personas](https://github.com/green-coding-services/links-documents-resources/blob/main/Links/Green-Software-Engineering-Personas-Organizations.md)

- [Green Software Engineering Desktop](https://github.com/green-coding-services/links-documents-resources/blob/main/Links/Green-Software-Engineering-Desktop.md)

The most promising link in there is probably the Green Software Foundation and
their planned [Green Software Projects](https://greensoftware.foundation/projects)

We are also working on this topic and planning to be part of the Green Software Foundation
either as a Group / NGO or as contributors.
As soon as we have some updates on this topic we will announce it in the blog.

For any feedback regarding our resources repo or if you want to supply some interesting
links we missed please hit us up at info@green-coding.io

As a final note I want to point out, that similar lists exist already.
And although we believe that our list is a valuable addition and contains the most relevant resources,
a shout out to the Green Software Foundation on their list: [Awesome Green Software](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/awesome-green-software)
