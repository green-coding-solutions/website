Starting this month we will be releasing articles in a regular fashion about insights
into energy use of specifc software tools or architectures.

In order to lay a foundation to follow these articles we have created at a [CO2 Formulas](/co2-formulas) 
page, where you can find all the relevant formulas how to calculate the energy
use of software.
Often times software can be directly instrumented and measured, but when the complexity 
gets too high (in network transmissions) or data is limited (in the cloud) then 
often assumptions are made.

We discuss these problematics and current academic approaches how to still get some
numbers.

## Case Studies

The case studies are our new format about specific questions we sometimes get from 
developers in our Meetups, but also about things we just wanted to drill down on.

For example:
- How much more energy does Wordpress consume compared to a static site?
- How much energy does content compression with `gzip` save?

Check out our case studies to get into the details: [Case Studies](/case-studies)
