How do you even present research online, if you do not want it to be read
mainly by developers?

## How is it currently done, and what is the problem we see

The classical way of publishing research is in journals and through the form
of papers. When coming from acadamia and being used to this format you can
very quickly scan a paper and find the relevant information you need.
Still, if you really wanna follow what the people have done in a paper and the
topic is a bit more complex the way how papers are often written is very hard
to read and can take up a lot of time.
Aferwards you sometimes feel you still did not fully understand it, because
it was only explained in one way and the raw data was not attached and also
there was no demo code you could run yourself.

## Our approach to making reasearch visible and fun to follow
This is why we want to present our research from a different angle:
- We want to publicize our lab diary by posting regular blog messages about
the research questions we are currently facing and our current approaches to
resolve them
- We want to regulary post demo codes so you can easily replay some stuff we
did and maybe also find errors in our assumptions or implementations
- As soon as we reached some milestones and got chunks of information ready
and confirmed by others we want to put them on wikipedia to make them more
accessible and also for others to branch out their own resarch on further questions
- Also when our work has reached significant milestones we wanna put it together
in a paper and let the scientific community re-evaluate our results and thus
foster a stronger validation or even falsification of our work.
- To make it better usable to developers we wanna keep an FAQ style site, similar
to StackOverflow, that in very easy language and with examples answers certain
questions.
- In conjuction we want to offer a classical documentation as you know it from APIs.
Because we believe this format is better for developers to consume information
and to interact with it than a paper etc.


## Our current open research questions
So in this spirit we wanna point you to an FAQ style page, that is similar
to an approach. with open research questions
that we are currently dealing with and even some answers we have already found
on them.

We would like to encourage you giving this way of presenting information a try
and give us feedback.
